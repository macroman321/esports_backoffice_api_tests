Feature: Gameserver

  # question: How do we automate this test cases given that total number of 
  # gameservers constantly changes. 
  # We can do this in 'dev' environment where we can have full control under the
  # system (ie. create database, test data etc). But how do we do that in stage
  # or prod. Could we, for example, get the list via UI and via API and compare
  # them? Does that makes sense?
