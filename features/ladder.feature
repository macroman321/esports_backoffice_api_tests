  Feature: Ladder

  # question: How do we automate this test case given that the total number of
  # ladders constantly changes.
  # We can do this in 'dev' environment where we can have full control under the
  # system (ie. create database, test data etc). But how do we do that in stage
  # or prod. Could we, for example, get the list via UI and via API and compare
  # them? Does that make sense?
  @dev_env
  Scenario: Verify the list of all ladders for all gameservers
    When I request a list of ladders for all gameservers
    Then I should see a list of ladders


  # this scenario has the same first step as the above, but only verifies  that
  # the request was succesfull, and a response with correct status was recevied.
  # it can be executed in any environment
  @all_env
  Scenario: Verify that GET /ladder API returns correct status
    When I request a list of ladders for all gameservers

  @all_env @bug @ESP-798
  Scenario: Verify that a list of all ladders for all gameservers is NOT received if wrong authorization token is provided
    When I request a list of ladders for all gameservers with invalid authorization token
    Then I should NOT see a list of ladders

  @stage_env
  Scenario: Verify that a new ladder is created using the appropriate API
    When I create new ladder for "gameserver1" gameserver
    And I request the latest page of the list of ladders for all gameservers
    Then I should see the ladder on the list of ladders

  @all_env @bug @ESP-798
  Scenario: Verify that a new ladder can't be created without choosing a gameserver
    When I try to create a new ladder for "gameserver1" gameserver without choosing a gameserver
    Then I should see the ladder is not created

  @all_env @bug @ESP-798
  Scenario: Verify that a new ladder can't be created without entering a ladder name
    When I try to create a new ladder for "gameserver1" gameserver without entering a name for the ladder
    Then I should see the ladder is not created

  @all_env @bug @ESP-798
  Scenario: Verify that a new ladder can't be created without entering a start date
    When I try to create a new ladder for "gameserver1" gameserver without entering a start date
    Then I should see the ladder is not created

  @stage_env
  Scenario: Verify that all info is returned on a single ladder using the appropriate API
    When I request information for "ladder1" ladder
    Then I should see information for that ladder

  @stage_env
  Scenario: Verify that a ladder is deleted using the appropriate API
    When I create new ladder for "gameserver1" gameserver
    And I request the latest page of the list of ladders for all gameservers
    Then I should get the ID from the created ladder
    When I delete a specific ladder on "gameserver1" gameserver
    And I request the latest page of the list of ladders for all gameservers
    Then I should see the ladder is no longer present in the list of ladders
